    <ol>Hello! Thank you for visiting this page. My name is Evan Iswahyudi. I am from Shoreline, Washington. 
        I graduated from University of Washington in 2017 majoring in GIS (Geographic Information System). 
        I have worked in different companies before I came into the web development. 
        My work experieces have taught me multitude skills in different areas. Looking back I would not be 
        where I am today without having these experiences. Currently, I am attending the University of Washington Bootcamp. 
        Initially, I was reluctant to go back to school after so many years of working. But, this program has been nothing 
        but AWESOME. Not only that I get to gain knowledge, but the students interactions, group discussions, projects, etc. have 
        made it more exciting! I cannot wait to learn more and be able to use it for the stuff I want to create. </ol>
       
    <ol>Things I like to do: Photography, Sports, Drumming, and Snowboarding. The good thing about my hobbies is that I get to be 
        active all year long. There is no season where I cannot enjoy esp. with photography. People often ask me what 
        I like to do for fun. And when I answer photography, that usually cover my base for all year long. There is beauty in 
        every season. 
    </ol>
